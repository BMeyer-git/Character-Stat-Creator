# Overview

This software is meant to help generate ability scores for a Dungeons and Dragons 5th edition character
and apply the stat bonuses according to their race.

While there are tools already out there for this purpose, I created this software to increase my familiarity with
rust and use various features such as structures within the development environment.

It starts with three example races and allocates stats using the standard array system, as found on dndbeyond.com as of 1/22/2022

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration.  It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code.  Focus should be on sharing what you learned about the language syntax.}
