# Overview

This software is meant to help generate ability scores for a Dungeons and Dragons 5th edition character
and apply the stat bonuses according to their race.

While there are tools already out there for this purpose, I created this software to increase my familiarity with
rust and use various features such as structures within the development environment.

It starts with three example races and allocates stats using the standard array system.
